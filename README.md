# workingTitle
workingTitle is a single-page bullet hell game where the player must avoid an onslaught of obstacles being thrown at them in sync with the background music.

## How To Play
The player begins on a static background. When they hit the start button, the mouse disappears, the background music starts, and they gain the ability to move around using either WASD or the arrow keys. Beware! Obstacles will now be thrown at the player at any increasing pace. Avoid the obstacles with WASD or the arrow keys until the end of the song to win!
